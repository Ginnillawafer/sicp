Running Scheme
====
- DrRacket http://download.racket-lang.org/
Once you download there is a program called DrRacket. DrRacket works for many programming languages. SICP uses Scheme. Under the Language menu you can switch the language to R5RS (which is Scheme version 5). The bottom half of the screen is a REPL (interactive prompt). The top half of the screen lets you write a program file.
- MIT/GNU Scheme https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/
